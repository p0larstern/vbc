Very simple tool which can be used for quick reference of items,  their prices and final amount whenever you are buying many vegetables at once.

### How to install
1. Install npm
2. Clone the repo
3. In repo folder, run `npm install`


### Development
Do `npm start` to run the start script which uses [parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) to bundle the source and starts a live server at [localhost:1234](localhost:1234)


### Github-pages hosting
- Currently the site is static so it is very easy to host the project on gh-pages
- Run `npm run build`, this creates a `docs` folder in the root directory which can be selected as the source directory for gh-pages deployment.
